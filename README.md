As a Business Analyst at Ozigen, one of the key tasks I handled was designing Notion pages to assign tasks to the team.

I’ve designed various Notion pages to delegate tasks, set deadlines, and ensure that all necessary information is included.

Think of a Notion page as a guideline for carrying out a project. If a project isn't completed on time, it often means the Notion page didn’t contain the right information.

I make sure every resource link and document is included, and I set clear deadlines for each milestone to ensure the project’s turnaround time isn’t delayed.

Please take a look at just a few of the many Notion pages I’ve designed.
